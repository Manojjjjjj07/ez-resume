## About the Project  
I built EZ Resume to provide a fast, flexible, and AI-assisted resume creation experience. The idea is to eliminate the hassle of traditional resume building by integrating automation, customization, and seamless export options.  

This project is a part of my learning journey in full-stack development, AI integration, and user-centric web applications and started as a small idea to make resume building *not* suck. It turned into something way cooler. The goal? **No more generic resumes, no more clunky UI, just smooth, AI-powered resume building.**

Hope you find it useful!

With Love, SKM ❤
